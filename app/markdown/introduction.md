# Introduction

GeneNetwork is a group of linked data sets and tools used to study
complex networks of genes, molecules, and higher order gene function
and phenotypes. GeneNetwork combines more than 25 years of legacy data
generated by hundreds of scientists together with sequence data (SNPs)
and massive transcriptome data sets (expression genetic or eQTL data
sets). The quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping module that is built
into GN is optimized for fast on-line analysis of traits that are
controlled by combinations of gene variants and environmental
factors. GeneNetwork can be used to study humans, mice (BXD, AXB, LXS,
etc.), rats (HXB), Drosophila, and plant species (barley and
Arabidopsis). Most of these population data sets are linked with dense
genetic maps (genotypes) that can be used to locate the genetic
modifiers that cause differences in expression and phenotypes,
including disease susceptibility.

Users are welcome to enter their own private data directly into
GeneNetwork to exploit the full range of analytic tools and to map
modulators in a powerful environment. This combination of data and
fast analytic functions enable users to study relations between
sequence variants, molecular networks, and function.
