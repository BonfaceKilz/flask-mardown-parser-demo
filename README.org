* Introduction

This project shows 2 ways of parsing markdown files for free flowing texts:

1. Reading from a markdown file
2. Making a network request on github

Both ways are flexible and there's no performance issues yet encountered

The markdown library used is "mistune"; chosen because of it's speed
and ease of use.
